# Angular Notes

*A small tasks/to-do list application made for fun, to test out my knowledge of Angular.*

The application includes the basic features of a to-do list app, with the ability to:
- Create tasks
- Edit task details
- Complete task
- View complete/incomplete tasks seperately

Future features may be added if I get around to it.

For the time being the application is just using a static set of JSON data that is included within the note note service.

## Installation

1. The application is built in Angular, and as such requires NodeJS and subsequently NPM installed.
2. With NPM installed, clone repository, and install dependencies via NPM.
3. cd into the project folder, and run 'ng serve'
